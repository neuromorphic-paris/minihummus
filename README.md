minihummus is a simple implementation of a spiking neural network (SNN) for educational purposes.

This implementation is meant to be a starting point in understanding how SNNs work, so we try to avoid any complex optimization tricks for the sake of clarity. We recommend using other simulators for real experiments.

## Install
```
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart
As an entry point take a look at the provided jupyter notebook: test.ipynb
