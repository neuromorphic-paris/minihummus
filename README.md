Minihummus is an educational tool designed to be a very simple introduction to spiking neural networks. For this purpose, we try to keep the code as clear as possible by avoiding any optimization tricks.

Single-layer feedforward networks for current-based leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons are supported at the moment.

## Install
```
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart
